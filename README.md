## Introduction

Connect to Amazons Selling Partner API with [Login With Amazon](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/connecting-to-the-selling-partner-api) (LWA).

## Requirements

- PHP 7.1 or higher.

## Installation

Install `Zerotoprod\SpapiLwa` via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require zero-to-prod/spapi-lwa
```

This will add the package to your projectâ€™s dependencies and create an autoloader entry for it.

## Usage

Use this for calling operations that require authorization from a selling partner. All operations that are not grantless operations require
authorization from a selling partner. When specifying this value, include the rrefresh_token parameter.

```php
use Zerotoprod\SpapiLwa\SpapiLwa;

$response = SpapiLwa::refreshToken(
            'https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token',
            'refresh_token',
            'client_id',
            'client_secret',
            'user-agent'
);
```

Use this for calling grantless operations. When specifying this value, include the scope parameter.

```php
use Zerotoprod\SpapiLwa\SpapiLwa;

SpapiLwa::clientCredentials(
            'https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token',
            'scope',
            'client_id',
            'client_secret',
            'user-agent'
);
```
