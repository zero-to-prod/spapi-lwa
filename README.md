## Introduction

Connect to Amazons Selling Partner API with [Login With Amazon](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/connecting-to-the-selling-partner-api) (
LWA).

## Requirements

- PHP 7.1 or higher.

## Installation

Install `Zerotoprod\SpapiLwa` via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require zero-to-prod/spapi-lwa
```

This will add the package to your projectâ€™s dependencies and create an autoloader entry for it.

## Usage

### Access Toke from Refresh Token

Use this for calling operations that require authorization from a selling partner. All operations that are not grantless operations require
authorization from a selling partner. When specifying this value, include the rrefresh_token parameter.

```php
use Zerotoprod\SpapiLwa\SpapiLwa;

$response = SpapiLwa::from('client_id','client_secret')
    ->refreshToken('refresh_token');

$access_token = $response['response']['access_token'];
```

### Access Token from Scope

Use this for calling grantless operations. When specifying this value, include the scope parameter.

```php
use Zerotoprod\SpapiLwa\SpapiLwa;

$response = SpapiLwa::from('client_id','client_secret')
    ->clientCredentials('scope');

$access_token = $response['response']['access_token'];
```

## Testing
You can test the api by faking the response:
```php
use Zerotoprod\SpapiLwa\SpapiLwa;
use Zerotoprod\SpapiLwa\Support\Testing\SpapiLwaResponseFactory;

SpapiLwa::fake(SpapiLwaResponseFactory::clientCredentialsOk());

SpapiLwa::from('client_id', 'client_secret')
```
